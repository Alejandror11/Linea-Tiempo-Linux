Linux Distribution Timeline | CONTRIBUTING
------------------------------------------

Because I want to keep it simple and coherent with previous versions by
the original maintainers, I decided to make this very simple guide of
how to contribute to this project. You are not obliged to follow this,
but you'll ease my job if you do. :)

Formatting
==========

Since we're working with CSV format, you can fill the right column
rather easily, since it is self-explanatory.

If you edit the CSV using LibreOffice Calc, make sure to load the file
with "Quoted field as text" enabled to prevent autoformatting.

Remember to keep the CSV coherent, newest distro will always go to the
lowest place. And also, please group it accordingly, a Debian-based
distro should never be grouped with a distro based on Red Hat.

I'll just give an example of how we can get it done.

	"Debian"
		"Ubuntu" based on Debian
			"Kubuntu" based on Ubuntu
			"Linux Mint" based on Ubuntu
		"Crunchbang" based on Debian
	"Red Hat"
		"Fedora Core" based on Red Hat
		"CentOS" based on Red Hat


Keep the original timeline (deprecated)
==========================

Don't understand what I meant? For example, S.u.S.E, before rebasing
their code to Red Hat, they originally used Slack as their upstream. If
you ever see this happening in the future, add it to the connectors,
again, coherent with the distros. You may see "Thickness" in the CSV in
the "Connectors" part. The thickness may vary from 1, 2 or 4. It has
already been explained in the build generated by gldt, but I'll just
explain it again.

1: Influence, developer switch
   (e.g.: CRUX to Arch)
2: Rebasing, substantial code flow, project overtaking
   (e.g. Red Hat to SuSE)
4: Developer & code sharing, project merging, hard forking
   (e.g. Maemo to MeeGo)


Start date
==========
For start dates use the date when the code has been made publicy available,
otherwise use the date of the first public release.


Dead Distros
============

People get bored with maintaining a dead distro with no interest from
the Linux community. Some of them have announcements on whether they
will discontinue it, or just killing it silently, or even better,
killing the whole website. What to do in these kinds of situation?

1. If the distro has an announcement or statement on discontinuing the
   distro, use the announcement date as stop date
2. If the distro has no news since last release but still have a pretty
   much active forums/community (even small), consider it active.
3. If it has no information of forums, but the website is active, and
   if it has no release since 3 years after its latest stable release,
   put the stop date on latest stable release + 3 years
4. If the website is dead and there's no other information, put the
   stop date on last stable release + 1 year

EXCEPTIONS:
If a distro announced its discontinuation (which effectively making a
date being it's stop date) and a fork of the discontinued distro is
announced after a distro is discontinued, push the stop date of the
upstream distro (which is the discontinued one) to the first
announcement (or first stable release) of the fork distro. Case in
point: MeeGo (to Mer and Tizen).
